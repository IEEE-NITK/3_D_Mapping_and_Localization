Work Plan for Dec:
First juniors will learn how to use the turtlebot3 package in gazebo and learn how to use it.
Second we will be using laser sensors to make a 2d map of an office world. We will be first manually moving the bot to map the office.
Third, using slam to autonomously navigate in the unknown environment and map the world.
